for(var x = 2; x<=6; x=x+2) {
    console.log(x);
}

// a loop is needed as the function needs to be executed more than once
    // this function needs to be executed every time a runner hits two miles until the sixth, not just at the sixth
// starting point of the loop is 2, because that's when the first output happens
// stopping point is 6
// the loop will know when to stop because the end of the loop is defined with x<=6
// the number of miles is incrementing by +2 every iteration of the loop
// we only need one variable, "x" which is representing miles ran
